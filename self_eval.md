# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

```I spent a long time with the syntax error for the hashes before it was caught by Kaitlyn.  It was right before the lesson so I didn't have the time to make a detailed post.  So I googled and figured out the basics of hash symbols and was able to make a quick video outlining my thoughts.  I prefer video questions to posts any day.  trouble shooting each individual piece of a hash was fun and taught me quite a bit about hashes that I wouldn't have known if the problem wasn't there.```

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

```I take notes on my iPad.  A relic from my teaching days.  But I've soon realized it is much more efficient and possibly beneficial to take notes through comments on my code.  A combo of both is good.```

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

```Really depends.  If the method or code error is intuitive or I have a hint in my head I'll work it out in my own code through trouble shooting each part.  If I have never seen the method name before or the problem gives no instinctual hints its faster to google.  Ruby-docs ftw```
